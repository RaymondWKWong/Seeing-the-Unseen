Applications of Machine Learning with Ultrasound Data for Non-Destructive Testing

Utilising machine learning to reconstruct a materialâ€™s polycrystalline orientation map using ultrasound
travel times. In addition, applying machine learning techniques to predict if an image pertaining
ultrasound data contains a flaw and returning the predicted size of the flaw.
